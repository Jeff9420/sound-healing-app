                There's no fixed rule! For <strong>meditation</strong>, start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase. For <strong>sleep</strong>, 30-60 minutes is ideal. For <strong>background focus</strong>, you can play continuously during work hours. Listen to your body - if you feel relaxed and centered, you're doing it right.
