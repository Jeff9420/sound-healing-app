# Social & Media Campaign Kit

## Platform Templates

### YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels (45-60s)
- **Hook (3s):** "Need instant calm?" overlay + quick visual from app.
- **Body (35s):** showcase category (e.g., Meditation Morning Focus) with captions.
- **CTA (5s):** "Stream 200+ healing sounds at soundflows.app" with URL sticker.
- **Hashtags:** `#soundhealing #meditationmusic #focusplaylist #sleepbetter`

### TikTok (Up to 60s)
- **Concept:** "POV: You close your laptop & step into a rainfall dome." Use trending audio at low volume + app audio.
- **Text Overlay:** Highlight benefit + CTA.
- **Call-to-Action:** Link-in-bio pointing to `pages/rain-sounds/`.

### Pinterest
- Create 1000x1500 static pins with headline + subhead (e.g., "Free Chakra Healing Playlist").
- Description: 2-3 sentences with keywords + CTA to landing pages.

### Reddit
- Post format: experience share + resource link.
- Example subreddits: `r/Meditation`, `r/SleepBetter`, `r/Yoga`. Always add value before linking.

### Discord / Community Events
- Host monthly "sound lounge" sessions; share Google Calendar invite.
- Provide recap + playlist link in community channel afterwards.

## Creative Assets Needed
1. Screen captures of new landing pages.
2. 15-second loops of audio + animated background from app.
3. Thumbnail templates (Canva/FIGMA) with consistent typography.

## Copy Bank
- **Short CTA:** "Build your nightly wind-down with immersive rain + hypnosis audio." (link `/pages/rain-sounds/`).
- **Long CTA:** "Join 200K+ listeners transforming their meditation practice. Stream curated chakra frequencies and download weekly guides at soundflows.app." (link `/pages/chakra-healing/`).

## KPI Targets
- Shorts/Reels: 2 posts/week, target 10% watch-through, 2% link click.
- Reddit Posts: 1 thread/week, target 20 upvotes, collect qualitative feedback.
- Pinterest Pins: 4 new pins/week, target 500 impressions per pin.

## Workflow
- Use a Notion board or Airtable to track Idea → Script → Production → Scheduled → Published.
- Automate cross-posting via Buffer (timezone: PST + CET).
- End each month with review: top performing formats, audience comments, conversion metrics.
