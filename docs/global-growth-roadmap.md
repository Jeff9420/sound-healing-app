# Global Growth Roadmap

## 1. Measurement Stack (Week 1)
- Connect **Google Analytics 4** (replace `gaMeasurementId` in `index.html` once the property is created).
- Add **Google Search Console** and submit `https://soundflows.app/sitemap.xml`.
- Register with **Bing Webmaster Tools**, **Yandex**, and **DuckDuckGo** to cover key overseas markets.
- Launch **Microsoft Clarity** session recordings (update `clarityProjectId` in `index.html`).

## 2. Content & SEO (Weeks 1-6)
- Publish **2 new articles per week** targeting English keywords (meditation, rain sounds, sound baths, sleep audio).
- Localize priority landing pages into **EN / ES / JA / KO** by duplicating files under `pages/<lang>/`.
- Update meta descriptions + OpenGraph for each article before publication.
- Build internal links from the homepage and category pages to all new content (use `Global Resource Hub`).
- Quarterly: produce downloadable resources (PDF sleep planner, meditation habit tracker) to capture emails.

## 3. Distribution Channels
- **YouTube & Shorts:** 2x 45–60s ambient visualization videos per week linking back to category pages.
- **Instagram & TikTok:** repurpose clips from the app’s animated backgrounds; add link-in-bio to `/pages/meditation/`.
- **Pinterest:** create static pins for sleep routines and meditation checklists with strong CTA buttons.
- **Reddit / Discord:** share case studies in r/Meditation, r/Sleep, and host monthly AMAs.
- **Partnership Outreach:** contact yoga studios, wellness newsletters, and mindfulness coaches offering co-branded playlists.

## 4. Acquisition Experiments (Weeks 4-8)
- Run a $200 test on **Meta Ads** targeting US/CA/UK audiences interested in mindfulness apps; drive to `/pages/meditation/`.
- Launch **Google Search Ads** on long-tail phrases like "free rain sounds for sleep" and "guided chakra journey".
- Collect sign-ups through a simple Typeform or ConvertKit landing page; tag by source for attribution.

## 5. Retention & Community
- Offer a monthly email digest ("Sound Healing Sunday") summarizing new playlists and blog articles.
- Host quarterly live sessions on YouTube or Zoom featuring guided meditations using the app.
- Encourage user-generated playlists; feature the best mixes on the homepage.

## 6. Reporting Cadence
- Weekly (Monday): traffic vs. goal, top referring sources, conversion events (email sign-ups / session plays).
- Monthly: SEO ranking changes, content output, ad experiment outcomes, community metrics.
- Quarterly: revisit persona assumptions, adjust content roadmap, archive under-performing channels.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Create GA4 + Clarity projects and update IDs in `index.html`.
2. Publish the six new landing/blog pages and request indexing via Search Console.
3. Schedule the first 4-week content calendar (topics + publish dates) using the new templates.
